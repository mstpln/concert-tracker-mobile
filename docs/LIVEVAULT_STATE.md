# LiveVault Current State

## Repository and current build

LiveVault is `mstpln/concert-tracker-mobile`. GitHub `main` is authoritative. Production is a GitHub Pages static PWA backed by the authenticated Cloudflare Worker `concert-tracker-api` and private R2 bucket `concert-tracker-data`.

Security Builds 1-3 are deployed. Browser and automation roles are verified, the legacy `API_TOKEN` has been removed, and browser writes were verified afterward. v77 focused research schedules are active and the one-time release-feed cleanup completed successfully.

Listening Build 3.1 and its focused Settings correction are merged and deployed as v78. The production Worker has the listening routes, the private archive and manifest are stored in R2, and a clean incognito browser successfully restored the complete history. The active implementation branch is `feature/v79-cloudflare-git-builds`, which prepares the existing Worker for controlled GitHub-connected Cloudflare Builds.

## Product purpose and navigation

This is a single-user concert tracker for followed bands, upcoming shows, attended history, concert alerts, Spotify releases, listening history, venues, statistics and user-owned concert preparation. Bottom navigation is **Concerts**, **Dates**, **Bands**, **Stats**, and **Alerts**.

## Listening Vault production state

The validated sanitized Spotify archive contains 250,403 eligible unique track listens from 2009-01-16 through 2026-07-29. It excludes Spotify Kids, podcasts, video, audiobooks, plays shorter than 30 seconds and discarded account/device/location fields.

Private R2 is now the durable source of truth while IndexedDB remains each device's fast offline working copy.

- Manifest: `listening/manifest.json`
- Archive: `listening/spotify-history/00c5c9987203e406d80ff623cac4139a2c2ac5c9942a501df049ddb5baf0da7d.json.gz`
- Canonical content SHA-256: `00c5c9987203e406d80ff623cac4139a2c2ac5c9942a501df049ddb5baf0da7d`
- Empty-device restore verifies SHA-256, schema and event count before replacing local history.
- Existing local history was preserved during rollout.
- Real listening history is never committed, included in QA, written to public artifacts or sent to providers in bulk.

## v79 Cloudflare Git Builds setup

v79 adds repository-owned deployment configuration for the existing Worker without changing application functionality or production data.

- `wrangler.jsonc` names the existing Worker `concert-tracker-api`.
- Entry point remains `worker.js`.
- R2 binding remains `BUCKET` connected to `concert-tracker-data`.
- Runtime secrets remain stored only in Cloudflare.
- `scripts/qa-cloudflare-builds.js` guards the Worker name, entry point, R2 binding, bucket name and absence of committed secrets.
- `docs/CLOUDFLARE_GIT_BUILDS.md` contains the one-time connection and rollback steps.
- `APP_VERSION` and `CACHE_NAME_LITERAL` are synchronized at v79.

After merge, the user will connect the existing Worker to GitHub manually. Production builds will use `main`, root `/`, no build command and deploy command `npx wrangler@4.114.0 deploy`. Build watch paths will be limited to Worker deployment files so app-only changes do not redeploy the Worker. Non-production branch builds remain disabled for the initial setup.

Automatic Worker deployment does not authorize R2 data changes, migrations, secret changes, binding changes, production workflows or provider calls. Those remain separately controlled.

## Focused research workflows

Structured Ticketmaster/Spotify research runs Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 01:00 UTC. Focused Tavily/Groq concert discovery runs on the 1st and 15th at 02:00 UTC. Both use the shared production-write concurrency group, UsageTracker controls and conditional writes.

The visible Releases feed accepts only actual Spotify catalogue releases with a trusted Spotify release ID and album URL. Concert alerts derive only from `concerts.json`; `news.json` remains the compatibility container for Spotify release items.

## Data ownership and safety

Bands and concerts preserve stable IDs, user-owned fields, provider ownership boundaries and unknown future fields. Listening source events remain distinct from derived LiveVault-band mapping, later identity relationships and optional album metadata.

QA uses fictional listening fixtures and the fake backend only. Automated tests may never contain the real archive, call the production Worker or send history to providers.

## Development workflow

Approve scope, create a branch, implement and test with synthetic data, maintain state/decisions/build facts, push and open a PR, then merge only after explicit `Merge it`. Once Cloudflare Git Builds is connected, a merged change to watched Worker deployment files may deploy the reviewed Worker automatically. R2 writes, migrations, secrets and production workflows remain separately authorized.
